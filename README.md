# libprotobuf-mutator for Apollo

## Overview
The repository is forked from [google/libprotobuf-mutator](https://github.com/google/libprotobuf-mutator) 
libprotobuf-mutator is a library to randomly mutate [protobuffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf) messages. 
It could be used together with guided fuzzing engine: [libFuzzer](http://libfuzzer.info). 
Customized for fuzzing test against Baidu [Apollo](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo) self-driving functionalities
## Prerequisite

To use libfuzzer, install clang-6.0 in the Apollo docker. 

```
sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://apt.llvm.org/trusty/ llvm-toolchain-trusty-6.0 main"
wget -O - http://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install clang-6.0 lldb-6.0 lld-6.0
```

After merging the pull request, you should have the following **requirements** ready
* `CROSSTOOL` file for clang-6.0 at `/apollo/tools/clang-6.0/`
* Several fuzz driver derived from unit test under `/apollo/modules/controller/` and `/apollo/modules/integration_test/` with the name contains `_fuzz`
* Updated `WORKSPACE.in` by adding a new git repository for a modified version of libprotbuf-mutator
* `BUILD` file for the third-party library located in `/apollo/third_party/libprotobuf-mutator.BUILD`

Before moving on to build the target module with fuzzing support, we need to fix one minor issue with `libfortran` in the Apollo docker
```
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgfortran.so.3 /usr/lib/libgfortran.so
```
## Usage
To compile the fuzzing unit test, using bazel build with the provided CROSSTOOL. We will use one of the controller fuzzing unit test as an example
```
bazel build --crosstool_top=tools/clang-6.0:toolchain modules/control/controller:lat_controller_fuzzer --compilation_mode=dbg
```
The target fuzzing unit test binary will be built in `bazel-bin` folder. 
If you take a look at the corresponding `BUILD` file:
```
cc_binary(
    name = "lat_controller_fuzzer",
    srcs = ["lat_controller_fuzzer.cc"],
    data = ["//modules/control:control_testdata"],
    deps = [
        ":lat_controller",
        "//modules/common:log",
        "//modules/common/time",
        "//modules/common/util",
        "//modules/common/vehicle_state:vehicle_state_provider",
        "//modules/control/proto:control_proto",
        "//modules/planning/proto:planning_proto",
        "@libprotobuf_mutator//:mutator",
    ],
    copts = ["-fsanitize=fuzzer,address",
    "-Iexternal/libprotobuf_mutator/src/libfuzzer/",],
    linkopts = ["-fsanitize=fuzzer,address"]
)
```
The binary is compiled with the option `-fsanitize=fuzzer,address`, the `fuzzer` option tells compiler to use `libFuzzer` driver to build, while the `address` adds AddressSanitizer. You can optionally add `UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer`,`LeakSanitizer`, `ThreadSanitizer`, and so on. 

Now, if we run the binary, the fuzzing test will start, and some runtime statistics will appear on the screen. If a crash is encountered, the fuzzing will stop, and the testcase will be saved. For more advanced commandline options, such as using seeds and dictionaries, please refer to the [libFuzzer](http://libfuzzer.info) page. 

The `ProtobufMutator` class implements mutations of the protobuf tree structure and mutations of individual fields. The field mutation logic is preliminary -- it can be further improved by overriding the `ProtobufMutator::Mutate*` methods with more sophisticated or domain specific logic, e.g. using [libFuzzer](http://libfuzzer.info)'s mutators.

`gdb` is prefered to be used for root cause diagnosis, and some simple instructions are provided
```
gdb bazel-bin/control/controller/lon_controller_fuzzer
set args ./crash-0x1234567
run 
bt  # output backtrace of crash
```

To apply one mutation to a protobuf object do the following:

```
class MyProtobufMutator : public protobuf_mutator::Mutator {
 public:
  MyProtobufMutator(uint32_t seed) : protobuf_mutator::Mutator(seed) {}
  // Optionally redefine the Mutate* methods to perform more sophisticated mutations.
}
void Mutate(MyMessage* message) {
  MyProtobufMutator mutator(my_random_seed);
  mutator.Mutate(message, 200);
}
```

See also the `modules/control/controller/lat_controller_fuzzer.cc` and `modules/control/controller/simple_control_fuzz.cc` in the pull request for more examples.
Here is a prototype of the fuzzer driver to be written for developers. 

```
#include "src/libfuzzer/libfuzzer_macro.h"

DEFINE_PROTO_FUZZER(const MyMessageType& input) {
  // Code which needs to be fuzzed.
  ConsumeMyMessageType(input);
}
```
